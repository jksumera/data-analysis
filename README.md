This repository contains my portfolio of data analyst projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

#ABOUT ME:
My name is Jon and I am currently a medical records clerk looking to advance my career as a data analyst. I earned my Masters degree at Arizona State University for Health Informatics. Through this program, I learned a lot, however, what piqued my interests were topics that covered how to develop relational database systems in healthcare and biomedical environments, biostatistical analysis, and data analysis using tools such as SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel. While my studies have focused on the healthcare and biomedical domain, data is so vast and I simply love problem-solving and finding hidden gems within data.
