# Data Analytics Portfolio
######
This repository contains my portfolio of data analyst projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

## About me:
My name is Jon, I live in Los Angeles County, and I am currently a medical records clerk looking to advance my career as a data analyst. I earned my Masters degree at Arizona State University for Health Informatics. Through this program, I learned a lot about health information technologies, however, what piqued my interests were topics that covered how to develop relational database systems in healthcare and biomedical environments, biostatistical analysis, and how to conduct data analysis from raw datasets provided by public health departments with tools such as SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel. While my studies have focused on the healthcare and biomedical domain, there is lots of data out there and I simply love problem-solving and finding hidden gems within data.
